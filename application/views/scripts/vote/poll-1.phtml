<p><em>Put by: Rodney Serkowski</em></p>
<p>Motion: To add, in the Pirate Party platform Section 2.<em>x</em>, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.<em>x</em>. Reform of Democratic Institutions</strong></p>
<p><u>All Levels of Government Should Recognise and Facilitate E-Petitions</u></p>
<p>Petitions are a well established and recognised form of political  participation. In order to broaden political participation  governments at all levels the state should recognise and facilitate electronic petitioning as a legitimate form of participation.</p>

<p><u>Petitions Should Enhance Democratic Participation</u></p>
<p>Recognition of all petitions must have attendant obligations upon the elected government when it reaches a pre-determined quota, which include mandated parliamentary discussion, meetings with petitioners and formal recognition of issues raised within the petition.</p>

<p>Motion: To add, in the Pirate Party platform Section 2.<em>x</em> the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.<em>x</em>. Open-sourcing of State Funded Software</strong></p>

<p>All software created or commissioned by the government should be open-sourced if paid for by the taxpayers. Open-source software is more valuable to the public than closed, proprietary software: open-source software can be adapted by knowledgeable end-users for additional uses not envisioned by the original creators. Open-source software is also open to inspection by the public, increasing the chances that security issues can be found and resolved quickly, and allowing for a greater degree of transparency in government.</p>

<p><em>Put by: Liam Pomfret</em></p>
<p>Motion: That the congress endorses the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pirate Party Australia condemns the ongoing patent wars and the destructive effects that it has on the economy and innovation in general.</p>
<p>Patents are not fulfilling the intended purpose for which they were created, to  give small players the protections they need to participate in research  and in the knowledge economy against larger firms who can better afford engaging in legal action and manoeuvres. This can in part be attributed  to the length patents are awarded for remaining unchanged even as  technology has improved at an exponential rate. Whereas historically  inventions may have taken several years to spread around the globe, today inventions can be created, distributed globally and then  superceded several times in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Organisations of all sizes are harmed by this war over patents, as all organisations  must participate in research and development in order to compete in the modern globalised economy. Patents as they stand currently have created a system in which organisations are forced to waste millions of dollars in legal budgets to defend themselves from rivals. Combined with the increasing trend of firms to speculation and hoarding of patents, organisations are now laying claim to increasingly trivial ideas and concepts.</p>
<p>These practices are clearly absurd, and a hinderence to innovation and  economic growth. Ideas are not natural property, and there is no inherent notion or right of ownership in an invention. An idea is part of the greater collective knowledge of society, regardless of if this idea may be an abstract process, business methodology, chemical formulae or a mathematical procedure or algorithm.</p>
